* Remove all CAS profile services when subsystem is removed
* Fix hard-coded service name in dependencies deployment processor
* Explore whether the application's configured security domain could be
  probed for presence of the IdentityAssertion login module as a means for
  enabling CAS support (so that in the simplest cases the cas.xml descriptor 
  isn't required at all)
* Proxy callback support.  The basic plan would be to have an additional
  undertow handler that receives the PGT callback from the CAS server.  It
  would be injected with a service that provides access to a JASIG 
  ProxyGrantingTicketStorage instance.  The handler would parse the PGT
  callback and update the storage object appropriately.  When a proxy
  callback path is configured in the profile, the TicketValidator created
  in JasigAuthenticator would be injected with the same 
  ProxyGrantingTicketStorage instance, and a ProxyRetriever instance that
  is configured with the same connection factory used by the ticket
  validator.
* Allow the cas.xml deployment descriptor to specify part (or all) of the
  configuration profile
* Provide attribute transformers for SAML response attributes.  A transformer
  is a function that takes the value of an attribute as received in a SAML
  response payload and returns a replacement value.  This would allow, for
  example, distinguished names representing groups to be converted to a simple
  group name -- the transformer would return a particular component of the
  distinguished name.  Transformers could be configured as subresources of
  either the CAS subsystem or of configuration profile.
