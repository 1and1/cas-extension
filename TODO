* Make a private opensaml module that specifies all of the dependencies that 
  are missing in the opensaml module that is included with Wildfly, so that 
  it is not necessary to tinker with Wildfly's opensaml module.
* Allow an empty cas.xml deployment descriptor (empty file or empty root 
  element); use the configuration profile named 'default'
* Use predefined module descriptors and Maven assemblies to build the module
  artifacts so that we're not having to work around the various (mis-)behaviors 
  of the Smartics module
* Proxy authentication support; the management model already includes all of 
  the relevant attributes; need to decide on a strategy for providing a 
  service the application can use to request a proxy ticket to
  access another application/service (e.g. bound JNDI resource, implicit
  CDI bean provided through a portable CDI extension, etc)
* Allowed proxies list support for proxy validation; the management model
  provides a way to specify proxy lists, but they're not used when creating
  a ticket validator
* Explore whether the application's configured security domain could be
  probed for presence of the IdentityAssertion login module as a means for
  enabling CAS support (so that the cas.xml descriptor isn't required at all)
* Allow the cas.xml deployment descriptor to specify part (or all) of the
  configuration profile
* Allow SSL configuration for CAS using a Wildfly security realm to specify
  the truststore, keystore for client authentication, etc.
