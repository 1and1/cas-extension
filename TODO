* Remove all CAS profile services when subsystem is removed
* Explore whether the application's configured security domain could be
  probed for presence of the IdentityAssertion login module as a means for
  enabling CAS support (so that in the simplest cases the cas.xml descriptor 
  isn't required at all)
* Allow the cas.xml deployment descriptor to specify part (or all) of the
  configuration profile.
* Support CAS gateway.  Need a basic mechanism (e.g. a cookie) for 
  determining that a request has already been redirected with the gateway 
  parameter, so that when the login redirect returns with no ticket parameter, 
  the user is not redirected again. Consider allowing the application to provide 
  an implementation of an interface like the JASIG GatewayResolver that modifies 
  the service URL before a gateway request is redirected to the CAS login resource.
  Consider adding a login module that gives the unauthenticated user an identity
  with some fixed roles(s) when a login gateway request comes back without an
  authentication ticket.
