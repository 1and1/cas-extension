* Remove all CAS profile services when subsystem is removed
* Explore whether the application's configured security domain could be
  probed for presence of the IdentityAssertion login module as a means for
  enabling CAS support (so that in the simplest cases the cas.xml descriptor 
  isn't required at all)
* Allow the cas.xml deployment descriptor to specify part (or all) of the
  configuration profile
