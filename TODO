* Provide the assertion object that resulted from a successful ticket
  validation to the application; need to decide on a strategy or 
  strategies (e.g. bound JNDI resource, implicit CDI bean provided through a 
  portable CDI extension, etc) and also manipulate the deployment's 
  module dependencies such that it includes the necessary API classes; 
  probably want the cas.xml descriptor to indicate that the application wants
  this support    
* Explore whether the application's configured security domain could be
  probed for presence of the IdentityAssertion login module as a means for
  enabling CAS support (so that in the simplest cases the cas.xml descriptor 
  isn't required at all)
* Allow the cas.xml deployment descriptor to specify part (or all) of the
  configuration profile
* Allow SSL configuration for CAS using a Wildfly security realm to specify
  the truststore, keystore for client authentication, etc and provide 
  configuration support for hostname verifier.
* Query string may be butchered by JasigAuthenticationService.constructServiceUrl 
* Remove all installed services when subsystem removed
